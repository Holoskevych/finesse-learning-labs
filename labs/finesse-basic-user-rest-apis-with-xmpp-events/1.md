## Overview
Cisco Finesse is a next-generation agent and supervisor desktop designed to provide a collaborative experience for the various communities that interact with your customer service organization.

In this lab, we will use the Google Chrome based REST test tool <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/" target="_blank">Postman</a> to execute APIs related to the user object. We will also use a XMPP enabled chat client <a href="https://pidgin.im/" target="_blank">Pidgin</a> to receive the XMPP events (notifications) from Finesse.

## Step 1: Check that the Finesse system is in service

> Finesse API resource for getting the information about the Finesse system
>  ```http
http://64.103.26.58:8082/finesse/api/SystemInfo
```
> For more details about /SystemInfo, see <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/media/finesseDevGuide2/CFIN_RF_S6109343_00_systeminfo-get.html" target="_blank">SystemInfo - GET</a>

The ``/SystemInfo`` API response represents the Finesse system and includes the deployment type, the peripheral ID, the installed license, the current system state, the XMPP server and pubSub domains, and the hostnames of the primary and secondary Finesse nodes.

1. Open a browser tab, click the **Apps** button on the shortcut toolbar, then select **Postman**.
2. In **Postman**, open a new tab or click the Reset button to clear any previously entered data.
3. Construct a REST **GET** request for the `/SystemInfo` resource.
 * In the field marked *Enter request URL here*, put the URL for the Finesse API ``/SystemInfo`` resource (See the URL listed above).
 * From the request method dropdown menu, make sure **GET** is selected.

4. Click the **Send** button to launch the request.
5. If the request is successful, you should get a HTTP status of 200 OK and see some XML formatted data with the status of the Finesse system.

6. Confirm that the Finesse system is in service by looking at the `<status>` tag for **IN_SERVICE**. If the Finesse system is not IN_SERVICE, please work with the system administrator to get the system in service before proceeding.
