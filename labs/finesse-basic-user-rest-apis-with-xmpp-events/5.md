## Step 5: Change the user’s state to READY & NOT READY

> Finesse API for changing the user state
>  ```http
http://64.103.26.58:8082/finesse/api/User/{id}
```
> For more details about /User, see <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/media/finesseDevGuide2/CFIN_RF_C1D2CCD7_00_change-agent-state.html" target="_blank">User - Change Agent State</a>

Changing the user’s state uses the same ``/User`` REST resource and HTTP **PUT** verb as the user Sign In API, but with different XML data in the request Body:

To change to READY:
```xml
<User>
     <state>READY</state>
</User>
```
To change to NOT_READY:
```xml
<User>
     <state>NOT_READY</state>
</User>
```

1. In **Postman**, construct a REST **PUT** request for the ``/User`` resource.
 * In the field marked *Enter request URL here*, put the URL for the Finesse API ``/User`` resource with the same {id} as **Step 2: Get the user information section**.
 * From the request method dropdown menu, make sure **PUT** is selected.
 * Select the **Authorization** tab, and select **Basic Auth**. A form containing username and password fields appear.
 * For the Basic Auth **username** value, enter the id that was used in the ``/User`` resource.
 * For the Basic Auth **password** value, enter the password of the user from the ``/User`` resource.
 * Click the **Update request** button to generate an authorization header.
 * Select the **Body** tab, and select the **raw** radio button. A dropdown menu containing the type of raw data appears.
 * Select **XML (application/xml)** from the dropdown menu.
 * In the large body text box, paste the XML user data under 'To change to READY' as shown above.

2. Click the **Send** button to launch the request.
3. If the request is successful, you should see a HTTP status of 202 Accepted and an empty Body textbox.

4. In **Pidigin**, on the XMPP console, you should see a user notification being sent from Finesse with the ``<state>`` tag value of READY. This confirms that the user changed their state successfully.

5. Repeat steps 1-4 in this section to change the user’s state to NOT_READY by using the 'To change to NOT_READY' XML user data as shown above. The reason for changing the agent state back to NOT_READY is because a user cannot sign out from READY state, which you will be doing in the next step
