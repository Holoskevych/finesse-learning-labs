> Finesse API resource for getting the user object
>  ```http
http://64.103.26.58:8082/finesse/api/User/{id}
```
> For more details about /User, see <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/media/finesseDevGuide2/CFIN_RF_G80CB92B_00_get-user.html" target="_blank">User - Get User</a>

The User object represents an agent or supervisor and includes information about the user, such as roles, state, and teams. 

1. In **Postman**, open a new tab or click the Reset button to clear any previously entered data.
2. Construct a REST **GET** request for the ``/User`` resource.
 * In the field marked *Enter request URL here*, put the URL for the Finesse API ``/User`` resource (see the URL listed above). The {id} is the username used in Step 2: Sign in the user to the XMPP client.
 * From the request method dropdown menu, make sure **GET** is selected.
 * Select the **Authorization** tab, and select **Basic Auth**. A form containing username and password fields appear.
 * For the Basic Auth **username** value, enter the id that was used in the ``/User`` resource.
 * For the Basic Auth **password** value, enter the password of the user from the ``/User`` resource.

5. If the value of the ``<state>`` tag is not LOGOUT, then the user is already logged in.
 * If the value of the ``<state>`` tag is NOT_READY, you can visit <a href="/lab/finesse-basic-user-rest-apis-with-xmpp-events/step/6">Step #6</a> to log the user out. Then, try the Learning Lab again.
 * If the value of the ``<state>`` tag is READY, you can visit <a href="/lab/finesse-basic-user-rest-apis-with-xmpp-events/step/5">Step #5</a> using the *To change to NOT_READY* for the HTTP request body followed by <a href="/lab/finesse-basic-user-rest-apis-with-xmpp-events/step/6">Step #6</a>. Then, try the Learning Lab again.
